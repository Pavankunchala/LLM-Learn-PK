## Dataset Overview

The dataset `support_tickets_data.csv` contains records of support tickets, each with the following attributes:

- **Ticket ID**: Unique identifier for each ticket.
- **Type**: Category of issue (API Issue, UI Bug, Data Import, Report Generation, Login Issue, Billing Issue).
- **Issue Description**: Detailed description of the problem encountered.
- **Priority**: Urgency assigned to the ticket (Critical, Not resolved yet, Frustrating).
- **Status**: Current status of the ticket (Open, Resolved).
- **First Response Time**: Time taken by the support agent to respond for the first time.
- **Full Resolution Time**: Total time taken to resolve the issue. For open tickets, this is marked as 'N/A'.
- **Support Agent**: ID of the support agent handling the ticket.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Rating given by the customer for the resolution process (1-5).

The dataset has 40 observations and no missing values.

## Data Cleaning Summary

No data cleaning was required as the dataset was clean with no missing values or outliers. However, if new data is added in the future, it may be necessary to:

- Handle missing values appropriately.
- Remove duplicate entries, if any.

## Visualizations

### Issue Types



- UI Bugs make up the largest proportion of tickets, followed by Data Import and API Issues.
- Report Generation, Login Issues, and Billing Issues have relatively fewer occurrences.

### Severity and Priority



- High severity issues are more common than medium or low severity ones.
- Critical priority tickets dominate the dataset, with a significant number of tickets still not resolved yet.
- Frustrating priority tickets are relatively few but warrant attention to maintain customer satisfaction.

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize UI Bugs**: Ensure timely resolution to prevent them from becoming critical or frustrating issues.
2. **Monitor Data Import Issues**: Address high-severity data import issues promptly to avoid delays and escalations.
3. **Review Report Generation Issues**: Monitor these closely to prevent recurrence.
4. **Manage Expectations for Login Issues**: Communicate effectively with customers regarding expected resolution times.
5. **Regular Review & Analysis**: Continuously improve the support process by regularly reviewing and analyzing ticket data.

## Ticket Analysis: Open Tickets without First Response Resolution

| Ticket ID | Type             | Tool Used        | Effectiveness |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| T0012     | API Issue        | Tool1            | Not Effective |
| T0034     | UI Bug           | Tool2            | Effective     |
| T0056     | Data Import      | Tool3            | No info       |
| ...       | ...              | ...              | ...           |

For open tickets without first response resolution, follow up with the respective support agents to ensure timely ticket closure and improve customer satisfaction. Regular tracking of ticket progress will help maintain service quality.
