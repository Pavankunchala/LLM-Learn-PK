          "These Are My Children | These Are My Children is an American television soap opera which ran on NBC from January 31, 1949, to February 25, 1949. The show was broadcast live from Chicago, Illinois, airing fifteen minutes a day, five days a week, at 5:00 p.m. EST. It is widely credited as the first soap opera broadcast on television. It may be more accurately described as the first daytime drama or the first soap opera strip, as it was preceded by DuMont series \"Faraway Hill\" in 1946 and \"Highway to the Stars\" in 1947, both of which are described as soap operas but aired later in the evenings and broadcast only once a week.",
          "Baby colic | Baby colic, also known as infantile colic, is defined as episodes of crying for more than three hours a day, for more than three days a week, for three weeks in an otherwise healthy child. Often crying occurs in the evening. It typically does not result in long term problems. The crying can cause frustration for the parents, depression following delivery, excess visits to the doctor, and child abuse.",
          "Breastfeeding | Breastfeeding, also known as nursing, is the feeding of babies and young children with milk from a woman's breast. Health professionals recommend that breastfeeding begin within the first hour of a baby's life and continue as often and as much as the baby wants. During the first few weeks of life babies may nurse roughly every two to three hours. The duration of a feeding is usually ten to fifteen minutes on each breast. Older children feed less often. Mothers may pump milk so that it can be used later when breastfeeding is not possible. Breastfeeding has a number of benefits to both mother and baby, which infant formula lacks.",

        "question": "My baby has been pooing 5-6 times a day for a week. In the last few days it has increased to 7 and they are very watery with green stringy bits in them. He does not seem unwell i.e no temperature and still eating. He now has a very bad nappy rash from the pooing ...help!",
        "rationale": "It seems like your baby might be experiencing gastrointestinal issues, possibly due to an imbalance or change in their diet. While it is not uncommon for babies to have increased bowel movements and changes in stool consistency, the presence of green stringy bits could indicate a possible intestinal infection or other digestive concerns.\n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Consult your pediatrician: Schedule an appointment with your baby's doctor to discuss their symptoms and get professional advice on the best course of action. They may recommend further tests, such as a stool sample analysis or blood work, to determine the cause of these changes in bowel movements.\n\n2. Review dietary habits: Evaluate any recent changes in your baby's diet that could be contributing to their symptoms. This includes breastfeeding mothers ensuring they are consuming a well-balanced and nutritious diet, as this can affect the quality of breast milk.\n\n3. Monitor for other signs: Keep an eye on your baby's overall health and behavior. If you notice any additional symptoms such as fever, vomiting, loss of appetite, or lethargy, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n4. Manage nappy rash: To help alleviate the discomfort caused by the increased bowel movements and subsequent nappy rash, gently clean your baby's bottom with warm water after each diaper change. Apply a barrier cream or ointment to protect their skin from further irritation.\n\n5. Stay hydrated: Ensure that your baby is drinking enough fluids throughout the day to help prevent dehydration, especially if they are experiencing watery stools. Breast milk and formula should be sufficient for most babies in this age group. However, consult with a pediatrician if you have concerns about their hydration levels.\n\nRemember that while these steps can help manage your baby's symptoms, it is essential to seek professional medical advice to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment plan.",
